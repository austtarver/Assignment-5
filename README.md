# Assignment-5
For this assignment I recreated the roll-a-ball game and added some modifications.

1. added intro and exit screen.
2. on the intro screen added input field for player name, and a dropdown for the number of rounds to be played.
3. added two sliders on the game screen: one for ball speed and the other for cube rotation speed.
4. counts targets that have been picked up and displays them on game screen.
5. added buttons to stop playing, restart, and exit game.
6. added sound effect that occurs when all of the targets have been picked up. (NOTE: in the zoom video, my sound effect sounds weird, but when downloaded and played it sounds perfect.)
